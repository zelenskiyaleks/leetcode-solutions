# 16. 3Sum Closest

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topic:** Arrays, Two Pointers, Sorting

## Problem

Given an integer array nums and an integer target, return the sum of three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

## Approach

- Sort the array
- Fix one element
- Use two pointers (left and right)
- Track the closest sum

## Complexity

**Time complexity:** O(n²)  
**Space complexity:** O(1)
